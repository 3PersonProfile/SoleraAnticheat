Updated-Solera is a continuation of Solera 2018.

Solera attempts to enforce "vanilla Minecraft" mechanics, as well as preventing players from abusing weaknesses in Minecraft or its protocol, making your server more safe. Organized in different sections, various checks are performed to test players doing, covering a wide range including flying and speeding, fighting hacks, fast block breaking and nukers, inventory hacks, chat spam and other types of malicious behaviour.

Installation
---------
* Drop the SoleraAnticheat.jar in to the plugins folder.
* Start your Spigot/CraftBukkit server. (Using /reload can have unwanted side effects with players still online, but also with complex plugins and cross-plugin dependencies, so we don't recommend it. Usually it should work with NCP.)

Hints
---------
* Be sure that your Spigot/CraftBukkit and Solera versions match together. The latest version of NCP is compatible with a wide range of CraftBukkit/Spigot versions.
* Don't use tabs in the config.yml file.
